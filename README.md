To open these in FreeSO, put the XML files you want to view in `/path/to/FreeSO/Content/Blueprints/` and then it will be available as the file name in the list after clicking the Sandbox Mode button.

[room_build_contest_blueprint.xml](./room_build_contest_blueprint.xml) is an empty lot with a 10x10 box on it to get started.
